# My website
This will eventually become bigger, but for now it is a begginers first website on the web.
Go to [my website](https://drairigh16.github.io/) to see it.
It is the result of this [tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website).
All due glory goes to Mozilla.

There is now a branch of the website that is based off of [Phaser's](phaser.io) great [tutorial](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1).
All due glory goes to them. This new game is [here](https://drairigh16.github.io/First%20Pro/index.html)
